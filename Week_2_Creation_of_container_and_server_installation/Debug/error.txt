TypeError: kwargs_from_env() got an unexpected keyword argument 'ssl_version'




The error you're encountering is related to an incompatibility between docker-compose and the version of the docker Python library it is using. The core issue is that docker-compose is calling a function, kwargs_from_env, with an unexpected keyword argument ssl_version. Here's a detailed explanation and steps to mitigate the problem:

Error Explanation
Error Message:

css
Copy code
TypeError: kwargs_from_env() got an unexpected keyword argument 'ssl_version'
This error occurs because docker-compose is attempting to use a function called kwargs_from_env with an argument (ssl_version) that the function does not expect. This typically happens when there's a mismatch between different versions of libraries.

docker-compose: This is the tool you're using, version 1.29.2 in this case.
docker Python library: This library is used internally by docker-compose to interact with Docker. The kwargs_from_env function is a part of this library.
Likely Causes
Version Mismatch: The docker-compose version you are using might not be compatible with the version of the docker Python library installed on your system. The ssl_version argument might have been added or removed in a recent update, causing this issue.

Environment Issues: Sometimes, discrepancies between global and virtual environment packages can lead to such issues.

Mitigation Steps
1. Upgrade/Downgrade Docker Compose
Ensure you are using a compatible version of docker-compose for your installed docker Python library. The easiest way is to upgrade to the latest version of docker-compose, which might have resolved compatibility issues:

bash
Copy code
pip install --upgrade docker-compose
Alternatively, if you need to use a specific version, check the compatibility with the docker library version you have and install that specific version:

bash
Copy code
pip install docker-compose==<version>
2. Upgrade/Downgrade Docker Python Library
If upgrading docker-compose doesn't resolve the issue, you may need to adjust the version of the docker Python library:

bash
Copy code
pip install --upgrade docker
Or install a specific version known to be compatible:

bash
Copy code
pip install docker==<version>
3. Check Compatibility
Refer to the official docker-compose and docker Python library documentation or release notes for information on compatible versions. This might give you an idea of which versions work together.

4. Virtual Environment
Ensure you are using a virtual environment to isolate package versions:

Create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv myenv
Activate the virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
Install docker-compose and docker in this environment:
bash
Copy code
pip install docker-compose
pip install docker
5. Reinstall Docker-Compose
Reinstalling docker-compose might also help:

Uninstall docker-compose:
bash
Copy code
pip uninstall docker-compose
Install it again:
bash
Copy code
pip install docker-compose
6. Consult Documentation
Check the docker-compose documentation and Docker's Python library documentation for any recent changes or known issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the version compatibility issue causing the TypeError.
